    <p> <br>We know that as an incoming freshman you may not know what
        you want to do as a major. If you are undecided or not sure
        if the major you chose is right for you, try taking some
        of these quizzes! These quizzes will suggest what your major
        should be based on your answers. <br><br> Villanova University also
        provides you with helpful resources on exploring majors. </p>
